# Customer Segmentation 

## Overview
This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior using clustering techniques. The goal is to segment customers into different groups based on their spending habits, income levels, and shopping preferences. These insights help businesses tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and optimize inventory management.

## Methodology
- **Dataset**: A retail transactional dataset containing attributes such as customer ID, age, income, purchase history, and product preferences.
- **Clustering Algorithm**: K-Prototype was used to identify patterns in customer behavior which supports both numerical and categorical features.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Clusters were analyzed based on spending patterns, income levels, age distribution, and purchasing frequency.

## Dependencies
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn kmodes
```
- **kmodes**: Required for running K-Prototypes clustering.
- **scikit-learn**: For K-Means clustering and preprocessing.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: Numerical computations.
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Data visualization.

## Data Sources
The dataset used for this project comes from Kaggle, available at:
